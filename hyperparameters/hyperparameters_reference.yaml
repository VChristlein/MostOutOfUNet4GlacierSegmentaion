# Test/Train/Validation split

    # Test images : 50 (choosen random with random_state =  1)
    # Train images : 144 (cheosen random using train_test_split with random_state=1 and test_size=0.2)
    # Validation Images: 50
    
# Data Augumentation: 144*8 = 1152 [rotate of 4 and flip of 2]

# preprocessing : Bilateral Filter(10, 95, 75), CLAHE(clipLimit=5.0, tileGridSize=(5, 5))

# stopping criteria : Early callBack if there is no decrease in validation loss for 32 iterations.
# initialization : default random initialization by keras

# Learning rate : Cyclic learning rate

# Major change with this Simulation : Dialated res block for TransferLearning
